**You**: Can you generate a bash script to lsubmit to the slurm scheduler that uses account ''lp_vsc30032', uses 2 nodes, 16 tasks on each node, each task uses 8 CPUs, the walltime is 44 hours, t30 minutes.  Load the module for Intel MPI and run the application 'cfd-simulation' that is in the current working directory. The outtput should be saved to a file 'compute.out'.

**Bard**: Sure, here is the bash script to submit to the SLURM scheduler:

```
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH -A lp_vsc30032
#SBATCH -N 2
#SBATCH -n 16
#SBATCH -c 8
#SBATCH -t 44:30

module load intelmpi

mpirun -np 16 cfd-simulation > compute.out
```

This script will:

* Use the `lp_vsc30032` account.
* Use 2 nodes, with 16 tasks on each node.
* Each task will use 8 CPUs.
* The walltime is 44 hours and 30 minutes.
* Load the module for Intel MPI.
* Run the `cfd-simulation` application in the current working directory.
* Save the output to a file called `compute.out`.

To submit this script to the SLURM scheduler, you can run the following command:

```
sbatch slurm.sh
```

This will submit the job to the scheduler, and it will start running as soon as there are available resources. You can track the status of the job by running the `squeue` command. Once the job is finished, you can find the output file in the current working directory.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

**You**: If I'm using 2 nodes, and 16 tasks per node, shuould the number of tasks not be  32 rather than 16?

**Bard**: You are correct. If you are using 2 nodes, each with 16 tasks, then the total number of tasks should be 32. The `slurm.sh` script that I provided has the `-n 16` option, which specifies the number of tasks. This should be changed to `-n 32` to match the number of nodes and tasks per node.

The updated script would look like this:

```
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH -A lp_vsc30032
#SBATCH -N 2
#SBATCH -n 32
#SBATCH -c 8
#SBATCH -t 44:30

module load intelmpi

mpirun -np 32 cfd-simulation > compute.out
```

Once you have updated the script, you can submit it to the SLURM scheduler by running the `sbatch slurm.sh` command.

**You**: Coould you replace the short options by long ones, e.g., -A by ---account and so on?

**Bard**: Sure, here is the bash script with the short options replaced by long ones:

```
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --account=lp_vsc30032
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --ntasks=32
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
#SBATCH --time=44:30

module load intelmpi

mpirun -np 32 cfd-simulation > compute.out
```

The long options for the `sbatch` command are as follows:

* `-A` or `--account`: The SLURM account to use.
* `-N` or `--nodes`: The number of nodes to use.
* `-n` or `--ntasks`: The number of tasks to run.
* `-c` or `--cpus-per-task`: The number of CPUs to use per task.
* `-t` or `--time`: The walltime in minutes.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

**You**: The module to use is in fact impi/2023.4.194, could you replace it?  Als o, the walltime is 4 hourss, 30 minuutes.

**Bard**: Sure, I can make those changes. Here is the bash script with the module and walltime updated:

```
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --account=lp_vsc30032
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --ntasks=32
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
#SBATCH --time=270

module load impi/2023.4.194

mpirun -np 32 cfd-simulation > compute.out
```

The walltime has been changed to 270 minutes, which is 4 hours and 30 minutes. The module to use has been changed to `impi/2023.4.194`.

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

**You**: I''d prefer the HH::MM:SS time format, could you adapt this?

**Bard**: Sure, I can adapt the script to use the HH:MM:SS time format. Here is the updated script:

```
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --account=lp_vsc30032
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --ntasks=32
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
#SBATCH --time=4:30:00

module load impi/2023.4.194

mpirun -np 32 cfd-simulation > compute.out
```

The walltime has been changed to 4:30:00, which is 4 hours and 30 minutes in HH:MM:SS format.

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

**You**: Excellent, thanks!

**Bard**: You're welcome! I'm glad I could be of assistance. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
