Can you convert the following GNU make file to a CMake CMakeLists.txt file?
  * The name of the project will be "gpu_openmp", the language is C++  and
    the version of the project is 1.0.
  * The command line options for the compiler should be set on each
    individual target.
  * The command line options for the linker should be set on each
    individual target.
  * The required C++ version is C++17.  Adherence to the C++ specification
    should be enforced, and no C++ extensions are allowed.
  * You can ignore the "clean" target.

CXX = nvc++
CXXFLAGS = -mp=gpu
LDFLAGS = -mp=gpu

all: devices.exe hello_world.exe

%.exe: %.o
	$(CXX) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $<

%.o: %.c
	$(CXX) -c $(CXXFLAGS) $<

clean:
	$(RM) $(wildcard *.o) $(wildcard *.exe)
