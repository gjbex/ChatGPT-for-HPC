Consider the following Python function:

def compute_stats(data):
    n = 0
    sum = 0.0
    sum2 = 0.0
    for value in data:
        n += 1
        sum += value
    mean = sum/n
    for value in data:
        sum2 += (value - mean)**2
    stddev = sqrt(sum2/(n - 1))
    return n, mean, stddev

Can you suggest pytest unit tests to test for edge and corner cases?
The individual tests should be implemented as separate unit tests, each
in its own function.
