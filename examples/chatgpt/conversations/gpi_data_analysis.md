------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly, here are the first 5 rows of the data set:



| Country | iso3c | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |

------------------

**You:**

Could you create a heatmaÂ£of this data?

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Here is the heatmap of the first 5 rows of the data set. The colors represent the values in the data, with darker red indicating higher values and darker blue indicating lower values. The x-axis shows the years, while the y-axis represents the index of the countries in the first 5 rows.

Would you like to perform any further analysis or have any specific questions about the heatmap?



------------------

**You:**

Could you add the names of the countries as y-axis labels in this heatmap?

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! Here is the updated heatmap with the names of the countries added as y-axis labels. The colors and axes remain the same as before, but now it's easier to identify which row corresponds to each country.

Would you like to do anything else with this data?



------------------

**You:**

Considering the whole dataset, could you give me the countries with the largest and smallest value in 2018?  Please also show those values.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

In the year 2018, the country with the largest value is Afghanistan, with a value of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>3.513</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">3.513</annotation></semantics></math><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.6444em;">3.513. On the other hand, the country with the smallest value is Iceland, with a value of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.112</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.112</annotation></semantics></math><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.6444em;">1.112.

**You:**

Could you plot the evolution of the values for Israel as a function of time in a line plot?

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Here is the line plot showing the evolution of values for Israel as a function of time. The x-axis represents the years, and the y-axis represents the values. Each point on the line corresponds to the value for a specific year.

Would you like to analyze this further or have any other questions?



------------------

**You:**

Does Iceland always have the lowest value in the period 2008-2022?

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

It appears that there was an issue with the data retrieval for identifying the countries with the minimum values each year. The indices seem to be incorrect, making the output unreliable.

Would you like me to correct this and run the analysis again?



------------------

**You:**

Could you give me a table with three columns:
  1. the year
  1. the name of the country that has the minimum value for that year
  1. the value for that country in that year
You can ignore missing values.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Here is the table showing the country with the minimum value for each year, along with the value itself:



| Year | Country with Min Value | Minimum Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2008 | Palestine | 0.000 |
| 2009 | Palestine | 0.000 |
| 2010 | Palestine | 0.000 |
| 2011 | Palestine | 0.000 |
| 2012 | Palestine | 0.000 |
| 2013 | Palestine | 0.000 |
| 2014 | Palestine | 0.000 |
| 2015 | Palestine | 0.000 |
| 2016 | Iceland | 1.152 |
| 2017 | Iceland | 1.097 |
| 2018 | Iceland | 1.112 |
| 2019 | Iceland | 1.094 |
| 2020 | Iceland | 1.104 |
| 2021 | Iceland | 1.146 |
| 2022 | Iceland | 1.107 |It appears that Iceland had the lowest non-zero value from 2016 to 2022. Before that, the minimum value was 0, attributed to Palestine. Would you like to explore this further?



------------------

**You:**

Please recompute the previous table, ignoring countries that have a value of 0.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

After ignoring countries with a value of 0, here is the updated table:



| Year | Country with Min Value | Minimum Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2008 | Iceland | 1.139 |
| 2009 | Iceland | 1.151 |
| 2010 | Iceland | 1.133 |
| 2011 | Iceland | 1.125 |
| 2012 | Iceland | 1.182 |
| 2013 | Iceland | 1.181 |
| 2014 | Iceland | 1.175 |
| 2015 | Iceland | 1.153 |
| 2016 | Iceland | 1.152 |
| 2017 | Iceland | 1.097 |
| 2018 | Iceland | 1.112 |
| 2019 | Iceland | 1.094 |
| 2020 | Iceland | 1.104 |
| 2021 | Iceland | 1.146 |
| 2022 | Iceland | 1.107 |Iceland indeed has the lowest value for every year in the period from 2008 to 2022, when ignoring countries with a value of 0.

**You:**

This data represents the Global Peace Index (GPI).  Could you explain why Iceland has the lowest value?

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

The Global Peace Index (GPI) is a measure of the relative peacefulness of countries and regions around the world. It is produced by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) and uses a range of indicators, including societal safety and security, ongoing domestic and international conflict, and the degree of militarization.

In the GPI, a lower score indicates a more peaceful country, while a higher score indicates less peace. Iceland consistently ranks as the most peaceful country in the world according to the GPI. There are several reasons for this:


- **No Military**: Iceland has no standing army, navy, or air force, which contributes to its low degree of militarization.
- **Low Crime Rate**: Iceland has one of the lowest crime rates in the world, including extremely low rates of violent crime.
- **Political Stability**: The country has a stable political system, and it ranks highly in terms of governmental transparency and low corruption.
- **Social Harmony**: Iceland has a high standard of living, excellent healthcare and education systems, and strong social cohesion, which contribute to its high levels of safety and security.
- **Neutral Foreign Policy**: Iceland has a policy of not participating in any armed conflicts, which keeps it out of international disputes that could otherwise affect its peace score.
- **Strong Social Welfare System**: The comprehensive social welfare system in Iceland helps in reducing inequality, thereby contributing to social peace.
- **Small Population**: With a small and relatively homogeneous population, social and community issues are easier to manage, contributing to the overall peace and stability of the country.
- **Natural Environment**: Some theories even suggest that the peaceful natural environment (low population density, plenty of open spaces) contributes to the peaceful mindset of its people.

For these and other reasons, Iceland consistently receives the lowest score (indicating the highest level of peace) on the Global Peace Index.
