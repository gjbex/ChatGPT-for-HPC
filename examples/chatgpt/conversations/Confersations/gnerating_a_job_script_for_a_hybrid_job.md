**ChatGPT:**

Can you help me write a job script for the Slurm scheduler that runs a hybrid MPI/OpenMP application on 4 compute nodes that have 32 cores each? Each MPI process should use 4 threads.  The application is build using Intel MPI, which is installed as a module, as well as with the Intel compiler suite.  Lmod modules are used to manage software versions.  The application is expected to run for 10 hours and each process will use 3 GB RAM.  The application is located in the directory in which the job will be submitted.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! Below is an example of a job script for the Slurm scheduler that meets your requirements:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=my_job
#SBATCH --nodes=4
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4
#SBATCH --time=10:00:00
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=3G

# Load required modules
module purge
module load intel/XX.XX.XX  # Replace with the desired Intel compiler version
module load intel-mpi/YY.YY.YY  # Replace with the desired Intel MPI version

# Set the number of threads for OpenMP
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4

# Change to the directory where the job will be submitted
cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR

# Run the MPI/OpenMP application
srun -n $SLURM_NTASKS ./your_application


```
Here's an explanation of the key directives and steps in the script:
  * `#SBATCH` directives specify the job parameters:

  * `--job-name` sets the name of the job (replace "my_job" with your desired name).  * `--nodes` specifies the number of compute nodes to use (4 in your case).  * `--ntasks-per-node` sets the number of MPI processes per node (8 in your case).  * `--cpus-per-task` specifies the number of CPUs per MPI process to allocate (4 in your case, matching the requested 4 threads).  * `--time` sets the maximum runtime for the job (10 hours in your case).  * `--mem-per-cpu` specifies the amount of memory required per CPU (3 GB in your case).</li><li>The `module` commands load the required software modules (Intel compiler and Intel MPI) using Lmod.
</li><li>The `export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4` command sets the number of threads to be used by OpenMP within each MPI process.
</li><li>The `cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR` command changes the working directory to the directory where the job script is submitted.
</li><li>Finally, the `srun -n $SLURM_NTASKS ./your_application` command launches the MPI/OpenMP application, with `-n` specifying the total number of MPI processes to run based on the `--ntasks-per-node` and `--nodes` parameters.
</li>Make sure to replace `your_application` with the appropriate command or executable to run your specific application.
Remember to adjust the module versions and other parameters as needed for your specific environment.

**ChatGPT:**

Could you please modify the script to use mpirun to launch the application rather than srun?

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! Here's the modified job script that uses `mpirun` to launch the application instead of `srun`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=my_job
#SBATCH --nodes=4
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4
#SBATCH --time=10:00:00
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=3G

# Load required modules
module purge
module load intel/XX.XX.XX  # Replace with the desired Intel compiler version
module load intel-mpi/YY.YY.YY  # Replace with the desired Intel MPI version

# Set the number of threads for OpenMP
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4

# Change to the directory where the job will be submitted
cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR

# Run the MPI/OpenMP application using mpirun
mpirun -np $SLURM_NTASKS ./your_application


```
In this modified script, the `srun` command is replaced with `mpirun -np $SLURM_NTASKS`, where `-np` specifies the total number of MPI processes to run based on the `--ntasks-per-node` and `--nodes` parameters.
Remember to replace `your_application` with the appropriate command or executable to run your specific application.
As before, make sure to adjust the module versions and other parameters according to your specific environment.

**ChatGPT:**

Is there an option to verify the pinning on the cores by mpirun?

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, you can use the `--report-bindings` option with `mpirun` to verify the core pinning for your MPI processes. This option provides information about the CPU binding of each process.
Here's an updated version of the job script that includes the `--report-bindings` option:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=my_job
#SBATCH --nodes=4
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4
#SBATCH --time=10:00:00
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=3G

# Load required modules
module purge
module load intel/XX.XX.XX  # Replace with the desired Intel compiler version
module load intel-mpi/YY.YY.YY  # Replace with the desired Intel MPI version

# Set the number of threads for OpenMP
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4

# Change to the directory where the job will be submitted
cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR

# Run the MPI/OpenMP application using mpirun and report core bindings
mpirun --report-bindings -np $SLURM_NTASKS ./your_application


```
With the `--report-bindings` option, `mpirun` will display information about how the MPI processes are pinned to CPU cores, ensuring that the desired core pinning is applied.
Make sure to replace `your_application` with the appropriate command or executable to run your specific application.
Again, adjust the module versions and other parameters as necessary for your specific environment.
