Can you give me a shell command to get useful metrics on a job run by the slurm scheduler?  It should show at least the walltime, the CPU time and maximum memory usage of the job.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, you can use the `sacct` command in SLURM to get a lot of information about a job, including the things you specified.
Here's an example of how to do it:
```bash
sacct -j <JobID> --format=JobID,JobName,MaxRSS,Elapsed,TotalCPU

```
Here's what each option does:
* `-j <JobID>` specifies the job id of the job you want information on. Replace `<JobID>` with the id of your job.* `--format=JobID,JobName,MaxRSS,Elapsed,TotalCPU` specifies which fields to display in the output. In this case, it will show the job ID, the job name, the maximum memory used (MaxRSS), the elapsed walltime (Elapsed), and the total CPU time used across all tasks (TotalCPU).Please note that `MaxRSS` might not be available for the job as a whole but rather for each individual task. If you want to see the resource usage per task or per node, you can add the `--long` option:
```bash
sacct -j <JobID> --format=JobID,JobName,MaxRSS,Elapsed,TotalCPU --long

```
In case the memory usage is not showing or showing as `0`, make sure that you have enabled `JobAcctGatherType` to `jobacct_gather/linux` in the Slurm configuration.

How can I estimate the parallel efficiency of a job run by slurm?

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Parallel efficiency, often known as scaling efficiency, is a measure of how effectively a parallel computing application uses multiple processors. It's typically defined as:
`Efficiency = (Serial runtime / Parallel runtime) / Number of processors`
In a perfect parallelization scenario, an application using N processors would run N times faster than it would using just one. But due to overhead from communication between processors, load imbalance, and other factors, real-world efficiency is usually less than 100%.
You can get the necessary information for a job from SLURM using the `sacct` command. Here's an example:
```bash
sacct -j <JobID> --format=JobID,Elapsed,AllocCPUS

```
This will print the JobID, the wall clock time Elapsed for the job, and the number of CPUs allocated to the job (AllocCPUS).
Let's say you have the serial runtime of the job, which we will denote as `T_serial`. You can compute the parallel runtime `T_parallel` from the Elapsed field in the `sacct` output, and `P` (number of processors used) from the AllocCPUS field.
Then you can compute efficiency (E) as follows:
```bash
E = (T_serial / T_parallel) / P

```
Note that this formula assumes the serial runtime `T_serial` is known. If it's not known, you would have to run the job in serial mode (i.e., with a single processor) to get this number.
Another thing to note is that the `sacct` command's output time is in the format of `[DD-[HH:]]MM:SS`. You might have to convert this to a consistent unit (e.g., seconds) to calculate the efficiency.
The last important consideration is that this calculation assumes that the problem size remains constant when increasing the number of processors, which is usually the case for strong scaling efficiency. If you increase the problem size along with the number of processors, then you are measuring weak scaling efficiency.

**ChatGPT:**

Can I estimate the parallel efficiency based on Elapsed and TotalCPU?

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, you can estimate parallel efficiency using the `Elapsed` time and `TotalCPU` time from the SLURM `sacct` command. The parallel efficiency can be estimated as the ratio of total CPU time to the product of the elapsed time and the number of processors (cores).
However, it's crucial to note that `TotalCPU` time includes the sum of all CPU time across all tasks and cores.
Here's an example command to get the required metrics:
```bash
sacct -j <JobID> --format=JobID,Elapsed,TotalCPU,AllocCPUS

```
Then, you can calculate the parallel efficiency (E) as follows:
```bash
E = TotalCPU / (Elapsed * AllocCPUS)

```
All times (`Elapsed`, `TotalCPU`) must be converted to the same units for this calculation to make sense.
If E is close to 1, it means the job scales very well and uses the allocated CPUs efficiently. If E is much less than 1, it means the job does not scale well, and adding more CPUs might not speed up the job proportionally.
Please note that the above method is an approximation and may not always accurately depict the parallel efficiency, especially in complex multi-node parallel scenarios where communication overhead and load balancing become significant.
