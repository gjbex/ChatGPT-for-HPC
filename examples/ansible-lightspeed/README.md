# Ansible LightSpeed

[Ansible LightSpeed](https://www.ansible.com/blog/welcome-to-the-ansible-lightspeed-technical-preview) is an AI tool accessible via the Ansible 
VSCode extension.  Its main functionality is to automatically
generate Ansible code, including playbooks and roles, based on 
natural language input. Users enter task descriptions in English, 
and the extension uses IBM Watson Code Assistant to generate the 
corresponding Ansible code.
