# Sourcery

[sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/).ai is a service for AI code reviews and
automatic refactoring.  It can be run on a Github repository, or integrated
in various IDEs.

If you run it on a Github repository, you can choose the branch and it will
generate a pull request with the proposed refactorings against that branch.
After reviewing the proposed changes, you can merge the pull request.

Note that this will only work for Python, not for C/C++/Fortran.
