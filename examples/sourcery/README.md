# Sourcery

sourcery.ai is a service for AI code reviews and automatic refactoring.  It
can be run on a Github repository, or integrated in various IDEs.

If you run it on a Github repository, you can choose the branch and it will
generate a pull request with the proposed refactorings against that branch.
After reviewing the proposed changes, you can merge the pull request.
