Aritificial Intelligence-based tools are increasingly popular.  You
probably used tools such as OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Bard for various
purposes, but can you use them successfully in the context of
High-Performance Computing (HPC)?

## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will

  * understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) work and understand
    their strong and weak points;
  * understand that such tools are only useful if you already
    have a reasonable level of domain knowledge;
  * understand various ways in which these tools can be used
    successfully;
  * know what to expect from shell-gpt;
  * know how to use ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to generate tests
    for your code;
  * know how to use ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to generate
    API documentation for your code;
  * use GitHub Copilot to generate boring, boilerplate code;
  * use ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot for debugging;
  * use ChatGPT Advanced Data Analysis for data exploration and
    visualization;
  * use ChatGPT from the command line;
  * use Ansible LightSpeed to generate Infrastructure-as-Code.

## Training materials

Slides are available in the
 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gjbex/ChatGPT-for-HPC),
as well as example code and hands-on material.


## Target audience

This training is for you if you want to save time and use HPC
systems more efficiently.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience programming in some programming language for the code
generation parts.  You are also expected to be familiar with Linux and an HPC
environment.
